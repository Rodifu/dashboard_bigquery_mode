# Dashboard with BigQuery and Mode
I created a Dashboard in Mode using SQL as language and BigQuery as database. I'll explain more about each analysis here.

# Starbucks SQL Analytics (Mode / BigQuery)

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries used to analyze Starbucks performance data, including revenue metrics, gross margin, customer retention, churn analysis, product profitability, and forecasting trends.

⚠️ The database is entirely fictional, created only to showcase SQL and Data Analytics skills.

All queries were developed for use in **Mode Analytics** and **BigQuery**, following best practices for analytical SQL. Furthermore I can't share a public link of interative Dashboard here, because this function is just for who pay the Mode, however I can share with you if you have a account in Mode, fell free for ask 🤗!
